# Windows_Explorer_Preview_Pane_WMV_URL
Previewing a WMA/WMV media format on Windows Explorer through its Preview Pane causes embedded URLs to be automatically opened in the default browser without displaying any prompt. This issue happens because the affected app, WMPRPH.exe (which is invoked by Windows Explorer when the Preview Pane is enabled) does not properly enforces security on script instructions contained in media files. The file must be associated with Windows Media Player. On Windows 11 on default settings the .ASF extension was associated with WMP. Interestingly this issue does not happen if the file is previewed on a file share but if it was downloaded to disk and contains the 'Mark-Of-The-Web' (MOTW) it will work.
